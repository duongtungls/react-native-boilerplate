## Prerequisites

* [Node](https://nodejs.org) v10 (it is recommended to install it via [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* A development machine set up for React Native by following [these instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
